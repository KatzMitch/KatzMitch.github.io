                        <span class="strong">Hello Everyone!</span>
                        <br><br>
                        My name is Mitchell Katz. I'm a sophomore computer science and drama double major at Tufts University in Medford, MA.
                        <br><br>
                        Welcome to my home page! This is my first stab at creating a personal website for Ming Chow's COMP20: Web Programming class. Right now it's just HTML and CSS, but as the semester progresses hopefully I can make this website more exciting and interactive.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="strong">What is Mitchell up to Right Now?</span>
                        <br><br>
                        Right now, I'm Stage Managing two shows at Tufts: the 3Ps Spring Major: At the Vanishing Point and a Senior Thesis: Next to Normal. At the Vanishing Point goes up March 5-7, and Next to Normal is April 21-22. Everyone should come see it and support the performing arts at Tufts!
                        <br><br>
                        I'm also TAing COMP15: Data Structures with Chris Gregg! Come to my office hours because the past two haven't had too many students needing help and I like assisting on these projects!
                        <br><br>
                        Right now for classes, besides COMP20, I'm taking COMP160: Algorithms, CD145: Technological Tools for Learning and Thinking, DR156: Directing II, and DR39: Contemporary American Theatre
                        <br><br>
                        Well, that's basically my life this semester!
