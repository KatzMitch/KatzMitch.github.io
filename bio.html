                <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
                <p class="ital">So here's a little bit about me:</p>
                <p>I was born in Seattle, WA. Family of 5: older brother, younger sister, and a Havanese Maltese dog named Casey. I went to high school in Seattle, but then chose to move out to Boston for college.</p>
                <p>I chose Tufts, and came to school here thinking I was going to be a chemistry major and pre-med. I took CHEM11 and dropped that idea pretty quickly. I actually liked the class, but I realized I didn't want to be a chem major. I took COMP11 on a whim and loved it (shoutout to Mark Sheldon!) so I took COMP15 thinking maybe I'd want to minor in CS or something. When the CS department sent out the email saying that registration was restricted to declared majors, it made me realize that I was leaning towards being a CS major anyways so I declared that semester.</p>
                <p>I also started taking Drama classes because I've always enjoyed theatre. I looked at how many I was interested in and realized that I'd be taking almost enough to make it a major. I still haven't declared my drama major, but that second major is coming.</p>
                <p>Well, that's about my life!</p>
